Would not it be great if we can list out the recently created venues as well as artist on the home page.

OR

Maybe you can list those venues which are used a lot or those artists who have given a lot of live performances on the home page under Trending Artists or Trending Venues.

But since for our use case it would be more relevant to list out the recently created venues or artists!

Following code does the same!

@app.route('/')
def index():
  venues = Venue.query.order_by(desc(Venue.created_date)).limit(10).all()
  artists = Artist.query.order_by(desc(Artist.created_date)).limit(10).all()
  return render_template('pages/home.html', venues=venues, artists=artists)
Also, do not forget to add the front end code in the file templates/pages/home.html

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h3>Recent Venues</h3>
    {% for venue in venues %}
      <a href="/venues/">
        <div>
          <h5></h5>
        </div>
      </a>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h3>Recent Artists</h3>
    {% for artist in artists %}
      <a href="/artists/">
        <div>
          <h5></h5>
        </div>
      </a>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
</div>
